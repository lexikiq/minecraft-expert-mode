# Minecraft Expert Mode
Expert Mode is a datapack for Minecraft 1.16 that increases difficulty, provides configurable options for maximum health, and more.  
Settings are global and will work on servers as well.

## Changes
- Difficulty is automatically set to hard (duh)
- Mob following range has been raised to the maximum, making it harder to lose you and easier to find you.
- Knockback has been removed to make it easier for mobs to combo you and harder for you to knock them away.
- Zombies always try to spawn reinforcements.
- Lightning creates a lot more fire.

### Optional Changes
A menu is sent when you join which provides configurable options. All of these options default to their vanilla defaults.
- Your maximum half-hearts can be set anywhere between 1 and 20.
- You can disable absorption from golden apples.
- You can disable natural regeneration of health, forcing you to brew potions or craft golden apples to regenerate health instead.

## Installation
[Download the repository](https://github.com/lexikiq/minecraft-expert-mode/archive/master.zip) and **extract** the folder within.
Then copy it to your datapacks folder or drag and drop it into the datapacks menu.
